AWS EKS Project

Introduction
This project is a step-by-step implementation of Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), aimed at streamlining the deployment and management of Kubernetes clusters in the cloud. This project demonstrates how EKS ties into AWS services to bring out a scalable, secure, and production-ready container orchestration platform.

I set up this repository to explain to developers the core building blocks of EKS, set up an AWS environment tailored for Kubernetes, and deploy containerized applications easily.

Features
EKS Setup: a fully configured EKS cluster with networking, IAM roles, and security groups for secure and efficient operation.
Cluster Creation Options: includes methods for creating EKS clusters using both the AWS Management Console and AWS CLI.
Application Deployment: demonstrates deploying containerized applications using Kubernetes deployment manifests and Docker images.
Comparison: indicates key differences between EKS and self-managed Kubernetes, helping users to select the best fit for their needs.
Components
Understanding EKS and Kubernetes

Advantages and trade-offs of using EKS versus self-managed Kubernetes clusters

Setting up an AWS environment
VPC creation, IAM user setup, and configuration tools like AWS CLI and kubectl

Cluster Management
Authentication, scaling, and updates in clusters, so high availability and performance

Deployment Pipeline
Docker-based application containerization to deploy applications via Kubernetes YAML files

Use cases
This project is useful for realizing how to manage Kubernetes clusters on AWS.
Learn the basics of deploying a containerized application.
Compare the operational differences between a managed and self-managed Kubernetes solution.

How I Built It
Infrastructure: AWS services such as VPC, IAM, and EKS are used to create the environment.

Tools: AWS CLI, kubectl, and Docker are configured to ensure effortless cluster management and application deployment.
Networking: Subnets, internet gateways, and security groups are set up to ensure secure communication.

YAML Manifests
Custom Kubernetes manifests were authored to deploy applications to the cluster.

This project has been my exploration and hands-on implementation of Kubernetes using AWS EKS. It's an excellent demonstration of how managed Kubernetes services can simplify modern application deployment.
